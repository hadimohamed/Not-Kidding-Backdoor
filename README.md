#Not Kidding Backdoors
backdoors now days is easy to be discovered by antivurs or even OS firewall so you can code your special backdoor on any platform you want to do sme jobs in machine of your victim
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-so in this project i created server and client ,client coded to be undiscoverable by antivrus server is coded in loopback ip 127.0.0.1 and i uploaded its source to change it if you want to your private ip in your network i used port 9000 you also can change it easilly 
- i created two servers one in .exe extension and other in python so you can use python script to be run on any machine linux,mac or even windows that has python engine installed on it
- this project is easy and simple but have a deep meaning that if you used a backdoor of kali linux its will be easy to be discovered by antivirus or firewall but when you create your own backdoor its may br a trojan horse to be undiscoverable and at the end you can do what you want to do on victim s machines 
- in this payload i created client that looking for server with static ip and oppened port and when client connected with server it s will be monitored then start control by show full black screen on victim s machinem which working with windows operating system , in comming versions of this S/W i will add many options to make full control but this is just a beginning
